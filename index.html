  <p class="description">If you like professional services, you going to <b>HATE</b> this company. What ever you try to explain them, they will make a selection of what you want to create. No. Is not your decision, even if you pay. Is their decision. They decide what you can or not use. They will refuse to create what you want, even if you are willing to pay. If you ask them to develop a <b>Snake Game</b>, they will create a <b>Rat Race</b> without Rats or Snakes. They will blame you from their incompetence and will not be transparent with you. They really look like a SCAM team, because ommiting information and hidening it, is what they know to do best.</p> <br>
  <p class="description">This page will describe in a <b>EXPLICIT</b> way, why you should <b>NOT</b> accept to spend your money with them. The next text and links are extracted from my experience. They use <b>Basecamp</b> but they don't read the documents you write. They can create a <b>Whatsapp group</b> with you, but they will not answer to your doubts or to your questions.</p> <br>

  <i>Description of my project</i>: My project is described in this [wiki](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com). You can choose the language you prefer and inside each, several links describe all details of this application I was about to develop with this team. I started with them in the year of 2024, Dezember, and yesterday, 10/03/2025 I quit before starting the development process, giving up from the money I already pay. This page use a formal language style, that ask the reader to think about what he/she is reading, taking notes, and with that skill that all students around the world do with text, anyone can define the several components that this application aims to have. After all this time, they demonstrate a big difficult to define those components, which lead me to explain them in detail. Even with that enfort, complications come up really fast, because as I describe above, they select the features they should develop, without questioning me about those. Communication was always in English and sadly I have a big difficult to understand their english, with their Hindi accent. It give me the sensation that they "eat" words, and in several moments I ask them to repeat, until the moment I just don't ask them again, because I was unable to understand. Therefor I suggest to write, since with text, we can understand better what each wish to describe. Sadly, they demonstrate a bit worst then AI, since AI think about the possibilities, giving suggestions about each detail. In the other hand, they don't suggest anything and just accept any change without questioning. A bit worst of what we expect years ago, from a computer without the ability to think.
