  <p class="description">If you like professional services, you going to <b>HATE</b> this company. What ever you try to explain them, they will make a selection of what you want to create. No. Is not your decision, even if you pay. Is their decision. They decide what you can or not use. They will refuse to create what you want, even if you are willing to pay. If you ask them to develop a <b>Snake Game</b>, they will create a <b>Rat Race</b> without Rats or Snakes. They will blame you from their incompetence and will not be transparent with you. They really look like a SCAM team, because ommiting information and hidening it, is what they know to do best.</p> <br>
  <p class="description">This page will describe in a <b>EXPLICIT</b> way, why you should <b>NOT</b> accept to spend your money with them. The next text and links are extracted from my experience. They use <b>Basecamp</b> but they don't read the documents you write. They can create a <b>Whatsapp group</b> with you, but they will not answer to your doubts or to your questions.</p>
